        <h1>The Undead Bois</h1>
        <h2>A little about the Undead Bois</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Hanford, WA where the transit system only allows living beings to catch a ride on the citie's buses, The Undead Bois have been making headlines recently after signing with Succubae Records<br>
          The Bois are known for pioneering a relatively new sub genre of gangster mumble rap, "Gangsta Grumble Grunts". The genre being a direct response to the unfair treatment of 'Mortally Challenged Individuals' by the local peacekeeping lodge, 'The Night Paladins Peacekeeping Unit' otherwise known as the NPPU.<br>
          Being a motley crew of six and having a variety of different types of undead, The Undead Bois represent the collective struggle from within their community through their music. With recent hits such as, "A Brain is a Brain" and "Appetite for Craniums". The Undead Bois demonstrate their inate prowess at conveying a message while also talking about their experiences in the Horror Ghettos of Hanford.<br>
